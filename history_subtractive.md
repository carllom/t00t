# T00T — Subtractive Engine: Development History

Dated performance measurements for the subtractive synthesis engine — the
original engine, predating the module system. See `module_subtractive.md` for
the current spec/design; `engine.md` for the shared dual-core architecture
this engine (and every other module) is built on.

## Performance

Measured duty cycles on the profiling pin (`PROFILE_PIN`, now GPIO 22):

- Idle: 0.85%
- Single voice, no LFO: 2-3%
- Single voice w. LFO: 5-6%
- 16 voice max usage (unreliable measurement): ~75%
- <16 voice normal usage (unreliable measurement): 50%

### Baseline before RP2350

This is the baseline measurements of the state before switching to RP2350 and upgrading the core:

- Idle: 0.81%
- Voice A: "Fairlight" sample (8-bit converted on the fly to Q15): 10.3%
- Voice B: Square wave (BLEP) with 3Hz LFO for duty cycle + Filter with Q envelope: 12.3%
- Voice C: Triangle with LFO controlling amplitude + Filter Q: 10.5%
- All 3 voices sustaining: 31.5%
- Intense work will overload the buffer. Moderate use will get it close to 100%

### Performance gain table

| Phase       | Idle  | Voc A | Voc B | Voc C | ABC   | Max   | Comment |
| - | - | - | - | - | - | - | - |
| RP2040      | 0.81% | 10.3% | 12.3% | 10.5% | 31.5% | >100% | |
| RP2350 port | 0.56% |  6.3% |  6.7% |  6.1% | 18.0% | ~80%  | No code changes, just retarget |
| float env.  | 0.52% |  6.5% |  6.7% |  6.2% | 18.3% | ~85%  | Calculate envelope using floats |
| "float" lfo | 0.52% |  6.3% |  7.0% |  6.4% | 18.7% | ~95%  | Float interface for LFO, but Q15 impl + sine lookup |
| SMULL filt. | 0.50% |  5.9% |  6.6% |  6.0% | 17.5% | ~90%  | |
| SSAT env.   | 0.44% |  5.9% |  6.5% |  5.9% | 17.4% | ~90%  | |

The following measurements were measured after a couple of additions: envelopes, effects, modularization (`subtractive` and `groovebox`).
The baseline reflects the state on 2026-08-06 prior to implementing `tracker`, `speech` and `fm` modules and the subblock optimizations.
Max is measured when using all 16 voice channels.

| no FX       | 0.48% |  6.4% |  6.9% |  6.3% |   -   | ~90%  | |

| no FX       | 0.53% |  6.9% |  7.4% |  6.8% |   -   | ~90%  | After pan fix (issue #11). Slight (~0.5% for active voice, 0.05% idle) raise in CPU |
| Delay FX    |  2.1% |  8.4% |  8.9% |  8.3% |   -   | ~90%  | After pan fix (issue #11). As above |
| Reverb FX   |  8.4% | 14.8% | 15.3% | 14.7% |   -   | ~90%  | After pan fix (issue #11). As above |
| | | | | | | | |
| no FX       |  0.6% |  5.9% |  5.7% |  5.1% |   -   | ~86/80/70%  | After subchunk fix (issue #12). Max is depending on voice used (A/B/C). Major improvement for modulator-heavy voices (Voice C)! |
| Delay FX    |  2.1% |  7.3% |  7.2% |  6.6% |   -   | ~86/80/70%  | After subchunk fix (issue #12) |
